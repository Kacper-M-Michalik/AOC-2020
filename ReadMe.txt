Some of these are botched as they were written for private use and speed of development, as such they will usually only contain soltuions for either only part 1 or only part 2, few allow parts 1 and 2 to be done via same code but are not set up with correct inputs to do so.
Less botched projects include days: 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 P1, 15, 17, 18, 22, 23
